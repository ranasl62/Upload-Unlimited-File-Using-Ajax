Upload unlimited file when you server allows only limited file at a time.

Here you can see two file upload option 
	1. uploadExcel()
	2. uploadWord()
Actually, I use this code in my project which is I done before 6 months ago.

I send two types of file and two different routes that's why I use two different methods.
You can use as you want. The way I did here is simple, take all file to the user and send it one by one.
